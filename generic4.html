							<p>The Heart Disease Classifier was predictive modeler that performed Logistic Regression to classify the patient as having heart disease or not having heart disease.
                               Using the Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset, which contained Age, Gender, Chest Pain, and Cholesterol.  This was developed using Python and NumPy.  The NumPy library was effective
                               in being able to import the dataset as well as doing some preliminary data preprocessing steps before building the algorithm from scratch.  Some Data Preprocessing techniques include
                               One-Hot Encoding, which was a method for converting categorical features into numerical features.  After thorough analysis, it was concluded that the model reached a total testing accuracy
                               of 90%.
