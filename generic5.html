							<h1 class="major">NBA COVID-19 Analyzer</h1>
							<p>The NBA COVID-19 Analyzer was a way to investigate how COVID-19 Affected the NBA.  I worked with 2 other undergraduate students throughout this project.  I was mainly involved in data collection, analysis, and visualization aspects of this
                                project.  I started off scraping data from ESPN using Python and BeautifulSoup for the Top 50 Offensive NBA Players.  I compared the players' performances during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 Affected Season ("Bubble") with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.  V
                                The data was visualized using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.  Overall, this was fully developed in the Jupyter notebook environment following a QQQ Reporting structure starting with a Hypothesis and leading to a Conclusion.  Eventually, after 
                                thorough analysis, it was concluded that the players performed better during the COVID-19 affected season.
